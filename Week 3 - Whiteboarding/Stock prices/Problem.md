The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the single highest profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days. For example, if the given array is {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695}, the maximum profit can earned by buying on day 4 and sell on day 6. It would return 694-40. If the given array of prices is sorted in decreasing order, return the lowest loss.
